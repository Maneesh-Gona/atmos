            <a href="Maneesh-Profile.html">Maneesh Gona</a>
            <ul>
              <li>
                    Maneesh Gona is currently studying at the Missouri University of Science and Technology.
                    Maneesh had a difficult life growing up, due in part to his parents.
                    His father is a South Indian from Kalkatta and his mother North Indian,
                    which was a source of cultural discord. Maneesh has an undiagnosed
                    psychological condition which makes it hard for him to understand people.
                    His mother left his family when he was 6 years old and Maneesh assumed
                    his father blamed him for it. This created distance between them and
                    resulted in Maneesh alienating himself further by immersing himself in
                    American pop-culture. His father allowed him to enroll at Rolla only
                    so he could take classes which would help Maneesh one day take over
                    his dad's falafel restaurant. Eventually Maneesh convinced his father
                    to let him study Computer Science and Computer Engineering.
                    During this time he grew close to a study group he joined, particularly
                    Michael Schoen who became his best friend and roommate.

            <ul>
              <li>
                    Michael is former scientist and inventor. He was once a leading pioneer
                    in the field of Virtual reality and the popularity of his inventions made him
                    high profile and in demand back in the 1990's. However, when the novelty of VR
                    wore off his celebrity faded and he fell on hard times. He eventually grew tired
                    of living off of his past acomplishments and peddling his outdated technologies
                    out of his RV camper. He took the opportunity to reinvent himself at the Missouri University of Science and Technology.
                    Michael became the head of the school's I.T. department.

              <ul>
                <li>
                    Frank possesses a sarcastic wit along with a vain and egotistical personality;
                    this is due to his mother over praising him when he was a child.
                    He is an Agnostic, although this can be seen as an example
                    of his tendency not to put any effort into anything. He hates talking about his
                    feelings and tries to avoid dealing with emotional conflicts.
                    Despite this, he has a charming personality and is known for his persuasive arguments,
                    a trait which served him well when he was an attorney. As Professor Kane pointed out to him
                    , he keeps people at a distance and cannot open himself up to others;
                    this is directly tied into his father's abandonment of him at an early age
                    . He confessed to his ex-boss Ted
                    that he admired the cool looking divorce lawyer
                    hired by his parents because he did his job without letting his personal feelings get
                    in the way. This, along with an unfortunate incident with a bully named "Big Cheddar"
                    , helped shape the negative aspects to his personality.
                    However, Frank's time with the study group has been a more positive influence and started to
                    change him for the better. When Alan Connor tells him he was responsible for his disbarment,
                    Frank thanks him as he genuinely values his time spent with the group.
                    Although the group originally tended to look to Frank as their leader, they began to rely on him less in this role.

              <ul>
                <li>
                    Adam was a former moist towelette tycoon who was at one time the C.E.O of "Reiter Wipes".
                    It was a company founded by his father, Cornelius Reiter which afforded Adam a leisurely
                    lifestyle. In his younger years, he lived it up, marrying seven times and accumulating over
                    thirty step-children. However, later in life, he found himself alone and unhappy. In an attempt
                    to cure his malaise, he started several hobbies including traveling the world, becoming a
                    Toastmaster, performing magic, and playing the piano. In 1999 he returned to school to further
                    expand his horizons and enrolled at Missouri University of Science and Technology.

                    Emily is a graduate of Rockwood Summit High School. She became estranged from her parents due to what she felt was bad parenting.
                    Emily entered a rebellious phase and dropped out of high school because she
                    thought it would impress Radiohead. She joined the Peace Corps, did some foot
                    modeling, attended a world-trade rally where she was tear-gassed, and visited
                    Africa. She also joined several activists groups but her memberships didn't
                    last long. A billboard vandalizing team of radicals kicked her out for not
                    being anarchistic enough despite her success at recruiting new members. She
                    was with a feminist group called the "An-Her-Chists" but it disbanded because
                    everyone involved no longer had the passion for their cause. This made Emily
                    realize she needed to move on as well.

                    Matt is a graduate from Rockwood Summit High and Maryville College.
                    A popular figure at Summit High, Matt was the star pitcher of the baseball team and also
                    the prom king. At the time, he had the interest
                    of many elite universities but couldn't handle the pressure of other people's expectations.
                    The night before a big game attended by college recruiters, he intentionally dislocated both
                    of his shoulders (or faked a knee injury, accounts vary) doing a keg flip at a party.

                    Elizabeth is a devout Baptist and is the most religious member of the study group whose surface good-natured
                    personality belies some thinly-veiled rage issues. While she is proud to be an American
                    woman and a mother, she tries not to be defined by just those characteristics. Her age is something she is
                    very sensitive about, as she is one of the older study group members and often tries to prove to them that
                    she is still relevant. She becomes the "mother hen" of the group often offering
                    unwanted advice or opinions to the other members. She admits to having a gossiping
                    problem, one which has cost her past relationships by needlessly stirring the pot between her friends.
                    It's been suggested by the study group that she also has a baking problem and tries
                    too hard to be liked by baking goods for everyone.

                    The daughter of a Jewish mother and an Episcopalian father. Her parents divorced and she,
                    along with her brother Anthony, were raised by their mother. At a very young age, Allie's mother
                    pushed her hard to succeed academically. In her teens, she attended Rockwood Summit High along
                    with her then crush, a local shirtless firefighter. She ended up losing her college scholarship (and her virginity)
                    and dropped out of high school due to an addiction to Adderall. Her drug abuse led to a nervous
                    breakdown that culminated in her jumping through a plate glass window and suffering severe injuries.
                    Her mother wanted to ignore the incident, but Allie chose to confront the addiction and go to rehab.
                    As a result, Allie became estranged from her family and eventually moved out. She began attending
                    Murray State College at the age of 18, and it's hinted that one of the main reasons is because
                    cute country boys go there.
