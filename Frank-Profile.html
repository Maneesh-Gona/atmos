        	                <li>Frank possesses a sarcastic wit along with a vain and egotistical personality;
                            this is due to his mother over praising him when he was a child.
                            He is an Agnostic, although this can be seen as an example
                            of his tendency not to put any effort into anything. He hates talking about his
                            feelings and tries to avoid dealing with emotional conflicts.
                            Despite this, he has a charming personality and is known for his persuasive arguments,
                            a trait which served him well when he was an attorney. As Professor Kane pointed out to him
                            , he keeps people at a distance and cannot open himself up to others;
                            this is directly tied into his father's abandonment of him at an early age
                            . He confessed to his ex-boss Ted
                            that he admired the cool looking divorce lawyer
                            hired by his parents because he did his job without letting his personal feelings get
                            in the way. This, along with an unfortunate incident with a bully named "Big Cheddar"
                            , helped shape the negative aspects to his personality.
                            However, Frank's time with the study group has been a more positive influence and started to
                            change him for the better. When Alan Connor tells him he was responsible for his disbarment,
                            Frank thanks him as he genuinely values his time spent with the group.
                            Although the group originally tended to look to Frank as their leader, they began to rely on him less in this role.</li>
